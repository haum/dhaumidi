# dHAUMidi

dHAUMidi is a music apparatus design by the [HAUM](http://haum.org).
It has been built upon the [dHAUM](https://github.com/haum/dhaum), a multipurpose geodetic structure.

Inside the dHAUM, several conductive objects are placed and connected to a [Léoké](http://leoke.desbwa.org) board. When
two or more objects are in contact or connected together (via a human chain for example) a Midi event is triggered and a
sound is emitted.
